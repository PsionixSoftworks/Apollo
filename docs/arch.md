Architectures
=============

Tier 1 Support
--------------
Tier 1 support architectures are platforms which active development is
considered vital to the movement of progress of the kernel.

* [x86-pc](arch/x86/pc)
* [Raspberry Pi 4](arch/aarch64/rpi4)

Tier 2 Support
--------------
Tier 2 support architectures are platforms which develop on their own time.
These are not needed to be feature complete for a release of the kernel.

* There are no Tier 2 Support architectures currently

Tier 3 Support
--------------
Tier 3 support architectures are platforms which are "on life support" so to
speak. These are architectures which aren't currently compiling and have had no
progress in that direction in over a year.

* There are no Tier 3 Support architectures currently

Create a New Architecture

* If there is a platform in which you want added to the apollo kernel support list
    please follow the [Create Your Own](arch/new-arch/Making-A-New-Arch) 
    Architecture guide.
