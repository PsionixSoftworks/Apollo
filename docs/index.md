Introduction
------------
The Apollo Project is a hobbyist operating system with the goal to be a
usable tool for developing applications and working with low-level
system interfaces.

We will take hints from Unix, however will not be another
Unix clone like GNU/Linux. We do not plan on porting any GNU utilities
however we do plan on being self-hosting via a GCC port sometime in the
future.
