Intel Programmable Interrupt Timer
==================================

Introduction
------------
The Intel i8254 is a chip that has been included in every IBM PC compatible 
since the original PC. It contains 3 channels which can generate pulses based
on programming. Traditionally on a PC, Channel 0 is connected to an IRQ, 
Channel 1 is connected to the PC Speaker, and Channel 2 was for DRAM refresh.
Channel 2 is not connected nor implemented in most modern PC's.

This driver contains configuration of the chip only. It does not handle
interrupts or controlling of the PC Beeper.

Modes
-----
The i8254 channels support 5 modes of operation:
 
| Mode | Description
|------|--------------
|    0 | Interrupt on Terminal count (Use internal counter to trigger pulse)
|    1 | Hardware One Shot (Gate sets trigger, timer goes low for N+1 cycles)
|    2 | Pulse Rate Generator (Generate periodic interrupt)
|    3 | Square Wave (50% duty cycle square wave output)
|    4 | Software triggered strobe (Timer goes low for N+1 cycles after trigger)

Frequency
---------
The i8254 Driver uses the `timekeeping_state_t` struct to control the frequency
it is passed as part of the driver initialization.
