16550 UART
==========

Introduction
------------

The 16550 UART is a widely used integrated circuit first released by National
Semiconductor is 1987. Most IBM compatible personal computers have a 16550 
compatible serial port, even modern ones via a motherboard header. This makes
it a wonderful debugging interface. 

Raspberry Pi
------------
The Raspberry Pi series of single board computers also feature a 16550 
*like* miniUART, which is available on the GPIO header. 
It does not feature proper full handshaking or many other features, however it
is a compatible enough implementation that the same driver can be used in
the Apollo kernel.

Baud Rate and Line Discipline
-----------------------------
The 16550 has a standard maximum baud rate of 115200 bits per second. This is
therefore a very standard baudrate which is compatible with a wide variety of
serial-to-USB adapters, and other RS-232 based equipment. By default, all
platforms default on apollo default to a baud rate of 115200 BPS.

The line discipline of the 16550 is fixed at 8-N-1 (8 data bits / No parity / 
1 stop bit). This was chosen as it is the most standard line discipline in use
today.
