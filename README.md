Requirements:
=================================================
This is a kernel project for x86 Hardware. Current compilation needs:
* GNU Make (Or Compatible)
* NASM, The Netwide Assembler
* GCC (cross compiler heavily suggested, such as i586-elf-gcc)
* grub-mkrescue (To generate a bootable ISO)

Optionally, for customizing builds, any application capable of reading Kconfig
files will work. If on debian based systems, the package `kconfig-frontends`
is suggested.

The kernel is written in X86-Assembly and ANSI-C. We are currently working
on making it as portable as possible.

Supported Architectures:
=================================================
Currently, only IBM-PC Compatible 486+ PC's are targeted, however this
will change with time.

Notable Features to Consider:
=================================================
This kernel is in development, and is therefore subject to major changes.
The API is in a state of flux. If developing applications, stick to
functions from the standard c library. All others may be depreciated /
removed without notice.

Running
=================================================
To run the kernel, any multiboot compatible bootloader will work.
An ISO is available in releases which is bootable as well.

Building
=================================================
Once all the pre-requisites software has been aquired,
you can build a kernel simply by typing `make all`. The make
file defaults to x86 with most of the features set.
To customize features you can either directly edit the
`.config` file in the root directory of the project, or
you can run `make menuconfig` if you have `kconfig-frontends`
or it's equivilent package installed on your distro.
An ISO file can be generated by running `make iso` after
compilation has been completed. The iso will be placed inside
the build directory.

History:
=================================================
This kernel descends from several failed kernel projects;
* ScorchOS; by Bob Moss and Allie Sargente. Circa 2010
* Mercury/SaturnOS; by Brandon Cornell and Allie Sargente. Circa 2012
* Apollo Kernel Project; Circa 2009-2011. Allie Sargente.

This kernel takes base code from Bkerndev and James Molloy's Tutorials:
